% annealing)

% simulated annealing is to be used

% This function depends on

% makeRandomPopulation : a function to create a random population of
% potential solutions

% evalPopulation : a function to evaluate each member of the population

% initialiseTemperature : a function to initialise the temperature of the
% annealing process

% crossOver : a function to apply a cross-over operator to the population

% randomMutation : a function to generate a random mutation

% evalEnergyChange : a function to evaluate the change in energy (i.e. the
% change in the evaluation function) induced by the given mutation

% applyMutation : a function to apply a random mutation
